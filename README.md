# Analyzing A/B Test Results for an e-commerce website

## Overview

Analyzing the results of an A/B test for an e-commerce website. The goal is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Tools

- Python (numpy, pandas, statsmodels, matplotlib)

## Findings

- From the results of the performed tests above we can conclude that we have no evidence of the new page conversion rate being higher than the old page conversion rate, and so we fail to reject the null hypothesis. and given that, we recommend that the company keep the old page.
